                <p class="fade-second">
                    It all started as a curious kid wondering ”how are these website-thingies made?”
                    ”What do they consist of?” This thought developed, and at age 13 (or thereabout), my very first website was live.
                    It was very close to magical, and I was so proud of myself.
                    This feeling, along with the fact that tech was seemingly right up my alley, made me even more curious.
                    And the rest, as they say, is history.
                    Okay, alright, I admit it – that ending is tacky, but I believe you get the idea.
                </p>
                <p class="fade-third">
                    Fast forward a decade, and here I am.
                    Currently, I am studying towards a Civil Engineering degree in Software Technology at DTU – Technical University of Denmark.
                    With DTU’s high ambitions and high expectations towards students and their dedication, this is a perfect match for me.
                    I have always had high ambitions, and I have never been afraid of taking up a challenge that could potentially broaden my skillset.
                    With this in mind, it is indeed very helpful, that I am also remarkably good at structuring and managing tasks and deadlines, such that I get to carry out most of the things I set my mind to.
                </p>
                <div class="read-more fade-fourth">
                    <p class="fade-first">
                        At this point, I bet you are thinking “Lasse, you are saying that you are a skilled techie with ambitions, but do you have any work experience to back this statement up?”
                        Yes, in fact, I do! Let us once again go back in time.
                        The curious kid finished school and high school, and with only his (undocumented) skillset and his high-school diploma, he landed a job as programmer at Morning Train, an Odense-based web agency, on equal terms with his (slightly older) programmer-coworkers.
                        He stayed there for a year, began his studies at DTU, and at this day, that kid grew up to be me.
                    </p>
                    <p class="fade-second">
                        Even though I started studying at a place far away from the offices of Morning Train, I continued my partnership with the organization, as I worked remotely for their sister-company, Morningscore, for the almost two years to follow while managing my studies.
                        This partnership ended in the fall of 2021, as I went to Leeds, England, for a study-abroad stay the entire fall.

                    If you believe I have an interesting profile, and I, perhaps, could be the right fit for your next project, then do not hesitate to contact me.
                    I would love to hear from you!
