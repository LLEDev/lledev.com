            <h1 class="fade-first">Hi! I’m Lasse and I have a great passion for technological engineering.</h1>

                <i>
                    At an early age, I discovered a great interest in technology.
                    Instead of simply enjoying playing video games, streaming music, or scrolling through websites, I have always found more interest in figuring out <b>how</b> these technological systems were built.
                    And at the age of 13, I built my first website.
                    Due to this curiosity about and passion for technology, I had absolutely no doubt in my mind when I had to decide what to do for a living.
                </i>
            </p>
            <p class="fade-third">
                Fast-forward a decade, and here I am.
                Currently, I am <b>studying a master's degree (MSc.) in Computer Science and Engineering at DTU – Technical University of Denmark</b>.
                I expect to graduate in the summer of 2024, and, in combination with my bachelor's degree (BSc.) in Software Technology, I will receive a Master of Science in Engineering degree (cand.polyt).
            </p>
            <p class="fade-fourth">
                With DTU’s high ambitions and high expectations towards students and their dedication, this is a perfect match for me.
                I have always had <b>high ambitions</b>, and I have never been afraid of taking up a challenge that could potentially broaden my skill set.
                With this in mind, it is indeed very helpful, that I am also <b>skilled at structuring and managing tasks and deadlines</b>, such that I get to carry out most of the things I set my mind to.
            </p>

                <p class="fade-first">
                    Going back in time, once again, I graduated from high school in 2018.
                    With my (undocumented) skill set within technological engineering and my high-school diploma, I managed to be hired as a full-time programmer on equal terms with my (slightly more experienced) coworkers at Morning Train, an Odense-based web agency, on the basis of my skills.
                    I worked there for a year after which began my studies at Technical University of Denmark in Kongens Lyngby.
                </p>
                <p class="fade-second">
                    Even though I started studying at a place far away from the office of Morning Train, I continued my partnership with the organization, as I worked remotely for their sister-company, Morningscore, for the almost two years to follow while managing my studies.
                    This partnership ended in the fall of 2021, as I went to Leeds, England, for a study-abroad stay the entire fall.
